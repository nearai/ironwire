//! Refreshing the signed provider-catalog document while the daemon runs.
//!
//! `docs/UPDATES.md` §2: catalog exist so that a changed `anthropic-beta` flag
//! is a minutes-long fix rather than a five-ecosystem release. That only holds
//! if a *running* daemon picks it up — a document that requires a restart to
//! take effect has the same latency as a release, which is the problem it was
//! built to solve.
//!
//! Two properties this must keep, both from `docs/TRUST.md` I2:
//!
//! - The URL is **pinned**, not configurable. A redirectable catalog source
//!   would be a supply-chain hole, and the schema deliberately cannot express a
//!   host so that a compromised *signing key* still cannot move traffic.
//! - Verification happens before parse, and a failure leaves the previous
//!   document in force. Fail-closed onto known-good values, never open.
