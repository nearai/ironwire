//! Putting the real values back, on a stream that respects nothing.
//!
//! This is the most dangerous code in the privacy filter, for a specific
//! reason: a response arrives in chunks whose boundaries are chosen by the
//! network, so a placeholder can be split at *any* byte. A reverser that
//! handles the common case and drops one in ten thousand tokens would corrupt a
//! transcript rarely enough to be shipped and often enough to matter.
//!
//! Two rules (`docs/PRIVACY.md` §5):
//!
//! 1. **Never emit a partial placeholder.** Bytes that might be the start of
//!    one are held until we know.
//! 2. **Never emit an unreversed placeholder we minted.** If the stream ends
//!    with one still pending, that is a failure the caller must surface — not
//!    something to flush and hope about.
