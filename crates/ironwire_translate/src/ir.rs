//! The pivot: one representation every wire parses into and emits from.
//!
//! `docs/TRANSLATION.md` is the design. The short version: three protocols make
//! six ordered pairs and eighteen mappings done pairwise, so everything goes
//! through a canonical form instead — three parsers in, three emitters out.
//!
//! Two properties hold everywhere in this module, and everything else depends
//! on them:
//!
//! 1. **The IR is a superset, not one of the wires.** Pivoting on Chat
//!    Completions would have been cheaper and would have silently degraded
//!    every route between the two formats that are *richer* than it.
//! 2. **Parsing is lossless; emitting reports the loss.** What a client sent is
//!    a fact. What a target can carry is a fact about that target. One function
//!    per pair conflates them; a pivot cannot.
