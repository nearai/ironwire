//! The request pipeline: peek, decide, send, fail over, stream.
//!
//! Two rules govern this file and both come from `docs/PROTOCOL.md`:
//!
//! 1. **Mutate only what §2 enumerates.** URL, auth headers, hop-by-hop
//!    headers, and — only when policy chose a different model — the `model`
//!    key, plus the separately consented admission metadata insertion. Nothing else is touched, which is why provider features we have
//!    never heard of keep working.
//! 2. **Failover ends at the first byte.** Once a byte of the response has
//!    reached the client, replaying the request would duplicate content the
//!    client has already committed to its transcript. After that point an
//!    upstream failure is surfaced on the open stream, never retried (§5).
