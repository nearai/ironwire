//! The event bus: telling the user what routing just did.
//!
//! IronWire has no UI channel into a coding agent. It cannot put a line in
//! Claude Code's transcript, and it should not try — the only writable channel
//! is the response stream itself, and injecting text there would put words in
//! the model's mouth and corrupt the conversation the agent stores. So the
//! answer to "how does the user find out" is a **side channel**, not an
//! in-band one: `ironwire watch` in a second terminal, the menu bar app, an
//! optional desktop notification, and the daemon's own output.
//!
//! One rule governs this module, and it is the same rule as the observation tee
//! (`docs/PROTOCOL.md` §2): **nothing here may stall or fail the forward
//! path.** Publishing is non-blocking and lossy by construction. A user who
//! misses an event sees a slightly less complete log; a user whose request
//! blocked on a notification sees a hung agent.
