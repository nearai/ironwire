//! Routing policy: the fidelity ladder, conversation affinity, and hysteresis.
//!
//! The decision this module makes is *per conversation*, not per request. A
//! coding agent's conversation carries a large warm prompt cache and, often,
//! provider-private reasoning state; moving it costs real money and real
//! latency, and moving it across API families can cost correctness
//! (`docs/CRITIQUE.md` §1). So a route change is a state transition taken under
//! sustained pressure, not a fresh choice made 200 times an hour.
