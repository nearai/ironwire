//! The capability gate.
//!
//! IronWire routes a request to a backend **only if that backend can preserve
//! the request's semantics**. Anything less is a refusal, not a downgrade
//! (`docs/DESIGN.md` §2). This module is where that rule is enforced, and it is
//! deliberately the smallest, most testable thing in the codebase: everything
//! about routing quality is a heuristic, but everything here should be a hard
//! fact about what the wire can carry.
//!
//! Keeping that distinction honest is the whole job. A gate that refuses a
//! route which would merely be *worse* is not caution — it is a bug that
//! silently deletes capacity the user is paying for. Every rule below is either
//! "the agent breaks" or "the user loses more money than the route saves";
//! anything that is only a quality loss belongs in the route's reason string,
//! not here.
