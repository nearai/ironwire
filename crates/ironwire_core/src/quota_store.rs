//! Carrying observed quota across a restart.
//!
//! What a provider told us about its own capacity is a fact with an expiry, and
//! until now it lived only in process memory. A daemon restart — a config
//! change, a `brew upgrade`, a laptop sleep, the `systemctl --user restart`
//! that `ironwire service install` sets up — threw all of it away, so the next
//! request walked straight back into a rate limit IronWire had been told about
//! five seconds earlier and burned a turn re-learning it.
//!
//! The whole design of this module is in the *load* rules, not the write. A
//! restored number must never be shown as though it were current: `ironwire
//! status` renders the observation's own age, and the one thing that would make
//! this feature worse than not having it is restamping `observed_at` to load
//! time, which turns "we knew this fourteen minutes ago" into a fabricated live
//! reading (`docs/CRITIQUE.md` §4).
//!
//! What is deliberately **not** here:
//!
//! - **Spend.** It is derived from the ledger, which is already durable. Two
//!   sources of truth for a number about money will disagree, and the ledger is
//!   the one that can be audited.
//! - **Circuit-breaker state.** An open circuit is a health inference *we* made,
//!   not something a provider stated — and the commonest reason to restart the
//!   daemon is that something was broken. Coming back up with our own pessimism
//!   intact would make a fixed problem look unfixed. A `retry-after` is
//!   categorically different: it came from the provider, with an expiry on it.
