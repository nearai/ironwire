//! IronWire core: the vocabulary every other crate agrees on.
//!
//! This crate depends on nothing else of ours and does no I/O. It holds the
//! wire protocols, the capability model that decides whether a route can
//! preserve a request's semantics, the observed-quota ledger, and the routing
//! policy.
//!
//! The one idea worth internalising before reading further: IronWire has two
//! lanes (see `docs/DESIGN.md` §2). The **native** lane forwards bytes without
//! re-encoding them, so its fidelity is 1.0 by construction. The **translated**
//! lane is capability-gated and *refuses* rather than degrades. Types here are
//! shaped to make the second lane's refusals cheap and total.
