//! Upstream backends.
//!
//! The native lane's contract (`docs/PROTOCOL.md` §2): for a request whose
//! inbound protocol matches the backend's, IronWire mutates the URL, the auth
//! headers, the hop-by-hop headers and — only when policy changed it — the
//! `model` key. Nothing else. The body is otherwise forwarded as the bytes the
//! client sent, and the response is forwarded back frame-for-frame.
//!
//! That is what makes fidelity 1.0 by construction, including for provider
//! features that did not exist when this shipped: unknown fields survive
//! because nothing here looks at them.

/// Join an OpenAI-family base URL to the path the client asked for.
///
/// An OpenAI-compatible `base_url` carries its own root, version segment and
/// all: `https://api.openai.com/v1` for the metered API,
/// `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex` for the ChatGPT subscription — and
/// `http://127.0.0.1:8463/openai/v1` is what IronWire tells Codex to use. The
/// client's own path arrives versioned on top of that (`/v1/responses`), so
/// concatenating the two gives `…/v1/v1/responses` or `…/codex/v1/responses`.
/// Both are 404s, against the two endpoints that actually matter.
///
/// The mocks did not catch this because a mock is mounted at the server root,
/// where the two spellings coincide — the one shape no real provider has.
