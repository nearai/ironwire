# IronWire menu bar app

A macOS `MenuBarExtra` that shows what the daemon is doing and lets you change
the few things worth changing from a menu. It is a **pure client** of the control
API (`docs/DESIGN.md` §6): it renders what the daemon reports and posts back what
you picked, and it decides nothing.

## Build and run

```bash
make -C macos test     # the Swift suite
make -C macos app      # build/IronWire.app — universal, ad-hoc signed
make -C macos run      # build it and launch it
make -C macos dist     # build/IronWire-macos.zip, the release artifact
make -C macos install  # into /Applications (PREFIX=~/Applications for one user)
```

Needs Xcode's toolchain (`xcodebuild -version` ≥ 15) and macOS 13 or newer.
`ARCHS=` skips the universal build for a faster local loop:

```bash
make -C macos app ARCHS=
```

Xcode opens `Package.swift` directly if you would rather work there.

## What it shows, and what it can change

**One pane**, read at a glance: every backend with its capacity, which coding
agents route through IronWire, the current route, spend, a pin control and the
privacy filter. A backend is something you turn on and then watch, so the switch
that turns it on sits on the backend's own row — off before consent, and showing
what the backend reports after it. Splitting those in two put the answer to "why
is nothing routing here" behind a tab.

**A control says its own state, so nothing under it repeats that.** A switch
that is off already reads "off", and a caption saying so again is what turned
this pane into a wall of orange text. What a control cannot say is carried as
its tooltip and its VoiceOver hint; a list nobody is reading right now — the
coding agents, the pin targets — lives behind a menu; and prose is left for the
things with no control at all, like a credential that is missing.

The privacy mode and each subscription can be changed from that pane. Both take
effect immediately — the daemon swaps the filter and the routing constraint
without a restart — and both are written down, so they survive one.

Three things it deliberately will not do:

- **Offer a privacy mode the daemon says is unselectable.** `full` routes only
  to backends you have named as acceptable, so with none named it would take
  every backend out of service. The daemon reports that, and the option is
  greyed out with its reason beside it, rather than the app working the rule out
  for itself.
- **Enable a subscription without saying what it costs.** A subscription is a
  switch, and one flip is the whole action — but the daemon's summary and every
  one of its points are on that switch as its tooltip and its VoiceOver hint, in
  the daemon's order and never reworded. The answer is sent with the
  `prompt_version` that was on screen, so it can be checked against the question
  it answered. `docs/TRUST.md` §2 records what this trades away relative to the
  CLI's two-step gate, which is unchanged.
- **Log you in.** A credential comes from you logging into Claude Code or Codex,
  or exporting an API key. A menu cannot conjure one, so a service without a
  credential says so and names the command that would fix it.

## The rule

**No routing logic in Swift.** Any conditional here that would have to change
when routing policy changes is a bug. If the app needs a derived value, the
field goes into `StatusView` and is computed in Rust — because two
implementations of "is this backend usable" that drift is the specific failure
a GUI over a daemon invites.

The concrete form of that rule is `Format.capacityFraction`, which returns
`nil` for every headroom state but `observed`. `ProgressView` wants a `Double`
and there isn't an honest one: zero reads as empty, a grey half-bar reads as
half, and both are numbers IronWire made up in the one surface a user takes in
without reading. So an unobserved backend gets the word `unknown` and **no bar**
(`AGENTS.md` rule 2, `docs/CRITIQUE.md` §4).

`Format` also mirrors the CLI's arithmetic — the ten-cell meter from
`render::meter()` and the 50/90 colour thresholds from `Style::by_usage` — so a
screenshot of this and a screenshot of `ironwire status` cannot disagree about
what "nearly full" looks like.

## Layout

```
Package.swift
Makefile                       app / dist / run / test / clean
Resources/Info.plist           LSUIElement, bundle id, version
Sources/IronWireKit/           everything decidable without a window
  Models.swift                 Codable mirrors of StatusView / Event
  Settings.swift               Codable mirrors of SettingsView / ConsentPrompt
  ControlClient.swift          discovery, polling, SSE, and the three writes
  Discovery.swift              $IRONWIRE_HOME, control.token, config.toml
  Format.swift                 the bar, the meter, the wording
  IconState.swift              what the icon says
  SSE.swift                    comment frames vs data frames
  NotificationPolicy.swift     which events are worth interrupting someone for
Sources/IronWire/              views and wiring only
  IronWireApp.swift            the MenuBarExtra scene
  MenuContent.swift            the pane: backends, consent switches, privacy
  MenuBarIcon.swift            drawing the four icon states
  LoginItem.swift              the "Open at login" toggle, over SMAppService
  Notifications.swift          opt-in UNUserNotificationCenter
Tests/
```

The split is what makes the rules testable: every decision lives in
`IronWireKit` and is covered by `swift test`, and the app target is left with
nothing but layout.

## Why SwiftPM and not an `.xcodeproj`

Issue #8 asks for `IronWire.xcodeproj`. This is a package instead, for two
reasons. The release job has to build the bundle from a script, so a
terminal-driven build is required either way — and a hand-authored `.pbxproj` is
several hundred lines of generated-looking UUIDs that no reviewer reads and
nobody hand-edits. `Package.swift` is a file you can read in one screen, Xcode
opens it directly, and `make app` produces the same bundle locally that CI
produces for a release.

## Decisions worth knowing about

**The App Sandbox is off.** The app reads `control.token` (mode 0600) from
`$IRONWIRE_HOME`, and a sandboxed app cannot see `~/.ironwire` without a
user-selected read entitlement — which means a file picker on first launch, for
a file the user has no reason to know about. The alternative, copying the token
somewhere the sandbox can reach, would mean a second copy of a credential that
grants control over where someone's traffic goes. Neither is worth it for a
local tool that talks only to `127.0.0.1`. If this ever ships through the App
Store, that decision has to be revisited, because the sandbox is mandatory there.

**The port is found with a line scan, not a TOML parser.** `Discovery.port`
looks for `port = N` under `[server]` in `config.toml` and falls back to 8463.
A TOML dependency is not worth one integer, and getting it wrong costs a
"not running" message — a state the app already handles — rather than anything
silent. A `port` under any other table is ignored, which is the only mistake a
naive search would actually make.

**The dropdown is `.window`, not `.menu`.** A real menu cannot express "no bar
here" as clearly as a view can, and `.window` gives `onAppear`/`onDisappear`,
which is how the poll rate switches between 5s closed and 1s open.
`/_ironwire/status` does a credential check per backend — a Keychain read for
the Claude one — so a one-second background poll would not be free.

**Notifications are off until asked for**, and authorisation is requested at the
moment they are switched on rather than at first launch. Only the events the
daemon itself considers user-visible produce one: a cross-family route, a
failure, and a spend cap being reached (`Event::is_user_visible` in
`crates/ironwire_proxy/src/events.rs`). A notification per route change would be
unusable, and the bus is deliberately lossy — this app is too.

**No install button, ever.** An available update is shown as a link and the
upgrade command for the user's install. IronWire never updates itself: it holds
credentials in the middle of streamed responses, and a restart mid-turn causes
exactly the outage the product exists to prevent (`docs/UPDATES.md` §1). A menu
bar app is the most tempting place in the codebase to break that.

**The privacy line is verbatim.** Whatever `status.privacy` says is what is
shown. No shield, no lock, no "protected" — `docs/TRUST.md` I7 forbids
describing the filter by what the user is safe from, and an icon is a
description.

## Testing against a real daemon

The unit suite covers the rules and the decoding. A handful of checks need an
actual daemon and are skipped without one:

```bash
ironwire serve &
IRONWIRE_LIVE=1 swift test --filter LiveDaemonTests
```

They cover the parts only a real server can show: that the document the daemon
emits is the one this app expects, that a 401 re-reads the token file and
retries once, and that a pin round-trips. One of them changes the daemon's pin
and clears it again, which is why they are opt-in.

For the states a real daemon will not produce on request — an open circuit, a
cross-family route, an unobserved backend, a tag from a newer daemon — the
dropdown is rendered off-screen with `ImageRenderer` in `MenuContentTests`.

## CI and distribution

`make -C macos test` runs on the macOS leg of CI only; the Linux legs cannot
build Swift and a red matrix on every push would be worse than no coverage.

The release job builds `IronWire-macos.zip` on the macOS runner and the Homebrew
formula installs it on macOS. The bundle is **ad-hoc signed**, which is enough to
run locally and enough to execute on Apple Silicon, but *not* enough for a bundle
that arrives from the internet: Gatekeeper wants notarisation, which needs an
Apple Developer certificate this project does not have yet. Until then, a
downloaded copy needs the quarantine attribute cleared by hand. See
`docs/PACKAGING.md`.
