//! Swift mirrors of the control API's view types.
//
// `StatusView` is the contract between the daemon and everything that displays
// it. `ironwire status` and `ironwire statusline` already read it; this app is
// the third reader, and it must show the same facts as the first two. When this
// app needs something new, the field goes into `StatusView` and is computed in
// Rust — never derived here (`docs/DESIGN.md` §6).
//
// The source of truth is `crates/ironwire_proxy/src/control.rs`. Two properties
// are carried over deliberately:
//
// 1. **Unknown tags degrade one field, never the menu.** `HeadroomView` and
//    `UpdateStatus` are `#[serde(tag = "state")]` and `Event` is
//    `#[serde(tag = "type")]`. A Swift enum that throws on an unrecognised tag
//    would blank the entire dropdown the first time the daemon is newer than the
//    app — which is the normal state, since the daemon outlives the app that
//    talks to it.
// 2. **A missing field is a default, not an error.** Several fields carry
//    `#[serde(default)]` on the Rust side precisely so an older daemon still
//    parses. Every decode here is `decodeIfPresent` for the same reason.
