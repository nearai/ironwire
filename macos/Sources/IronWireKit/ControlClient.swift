// `GET /_ironwire/events`, and `POST /_ironwire/pin`. Everything the menu shows
// comes out of the first; the second exists so the first happens sooner.
//
// Two properties are carried over from `ironwire statusline`
// (`src/commands/statusline.rs`), which is the closest existing client:
//
// - **A daemon that is not running is a normal state.** It is not an error, it
//   does not deserve a dialog, and it must not fill anyone's console. It
//   recovers on its own when the daemon comes back.
// - **Nothing is invented on failure.** A poll that fails drops what it knew
//   rather than redrawing it as though it were current — see `forget(_:)`.
