// The settings screen is where a GUI is most tempted to grow its own opinion:
// four privacy modes look like four buttons, and "log in" looks like something
// an app should just do. Both would be wrong.

// So this type carries the *decisions* as well as the values. Whether `full` is
// selectable is a rule that lives in `full_is_blocked` (`control.rs`) and is
// more than it looks — a named destination is not a usable one — so the app
// reads `selectable` and `unavailableBecause` and never the inputs behind them.
// The consent question arrives as text from the daemon,
// because a second copy of a consent prompt is a second prompt while the
// recorded version claims otherwise (`docs/TRUST.md` §2).
