//! The dropdown.
//
// One pane. A backend is a thing you turn on and then watch, so the switch that
// turns it on and the capacity it reports live on the same row: off before
// consent, showing what the backend reports after it. Splitting those into a
// Status tab and a Settings tab meant the answer to "why is nothing routing
// here" was behind a segmented control.
//
// This mirrors `render::status()` in `src/render.rs`, which is the reference for
// what is honest to show — and, more usefully, for what not to. Three of its
// rules are load-bearing here:
//
// - **No bar without an observation.** `Format.capacityFraction` returns `nil`
//   for everything but `observed`, and this file draws nothing when it does.
// - **The privacy line is verbatim.** No shield, no lock, no "protected".
//   `docs/TRUST.md` I7 forbids describing the filter by what the user is safe
//   from, and an icon is a description.
// - **An update is news, never a button.** `docs/UPDATES.md` §1: the daemon
//   holds credentials in the middle of streamed responses and never updates
//   itself. A menu bar app is the most tempting place to break that.
//
// The fourth rule is the menu bar's own, and it is why this file keeps
// shrinking: **a control says its own state, so nothing under it repeats that.**
// A switch that is off already reads "off"; a caption saying so is a second
// voice for the same fact, and a dozen of them is what made this pane a wall of
// orange text. What a control cannot say — the consent question, the file a
// tool's row would write — is carried as its tooltip and its VoiceOver hint,
// and a list nobody is reading right now lives behind a submenu. Text is left
// for the things with no control at all: a credential that is missing, a
// warning about what a write did not do.
