//! The app.
//
// A `MenuBarExtra` and nothing else — no window, no dock icon (`LSUIElement` in
// `Resources/Info.plist`). The whole program is: poll the daemon, draw what it
// said, and post a pin when the user picks one.
//
// `.window` rather than `.menu` for the dropdown style, for two reasons that are
// not cosmetic. A capacity bar has to be *absent* for an unobserved backend, and
// a real menu cannot express that as clearly as a view can. And `.window` gives
// `onAppear`/`onDisappear` on the content, which is the signal the poll rate
// switches on — `/_ironwire/status` costs a credential check per backend, so
// polling every second in the background would not be free.
