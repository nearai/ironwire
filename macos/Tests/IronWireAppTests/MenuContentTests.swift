//
// `ImageRenderer` lays the menu out exactly as the menu bar would, without a
// screen, a click, or a permission prompt. That buys two things the unit tests
// cannot: proof that every state actually *lays out* — a view that trapped on a
// `nil` would fail here — and a measurement of the one rule this app is most
// likely to break quietly.
//
// The bar test is the reason this file exists. `Format.capacityFraction`
// returning `nil` is necessary but not sufficient: a view could still draw a
// `ProgressView` beside it, and no test of the formatter would notice. The
// assertion is on laid-out height, because a bar occupies vertical space that
// text does not — see `height(for:)` for why height and not pixels.
